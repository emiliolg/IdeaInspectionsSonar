This inspection reports any log statements which are not surrounded by a guard
condition. The evaluation of the argument(s) of a log statement can be expensive.
Surrounding a log statement with a guard clause prevents that cost when the logging
is disabled for the level used by the logging statement. This is especially for the
least serious level (trace, debug, finest) of logging statements, because those are
most often disabled in a production environment.
<p>
Use the text field below to specify the logger class name used. Use the table
to specify the log methods this inspection should warn on, with the corresponding
logging condition text.
