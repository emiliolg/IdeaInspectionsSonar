This inspection reports any chains of if-else statements all of whose conditions are <b><font color="#000080">instanceof</font></b> expressions
(or combinations of such expressions).  Such constructions usually indicate a failure of object-oriented design, which
dictates that such type-based dispatch should be done via polymorphic method calls rather than explicit chains
of type tests.
