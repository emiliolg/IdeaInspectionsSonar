This inspection reports any <b><font color="#000080">import</font></b>
statements that are covered by previous <b><font color="#000080">import</font></b>
statements in the same file.  Since IDEA can automatically
detect and fix such statements with its "Optimize Imports" command, this inspection is mostly useful
for off-line reporting on code bases that you don't intend to change.
