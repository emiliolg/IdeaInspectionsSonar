This inspection reports any calls to a simple property getter from within the property's class.
A simple property getter is defined as one which simply returns the value of a field,
and does no other calculation.  Such simple getter calls may be safely inlined, at a small performance
improvement. Some coding standards also suggest against the use of simple getters for code clarity
reasons.
