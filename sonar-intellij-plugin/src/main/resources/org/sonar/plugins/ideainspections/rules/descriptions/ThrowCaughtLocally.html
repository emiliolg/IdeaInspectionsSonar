This inspection reports any instances of <b><font color="#000080">throw</font></b> statements whose exceptions are always
caught by containing <b><font color="#000080">try</font></b> statements.  Using <b><font color="#000080">throw</font></b>
statements as a "goto" to change the local flow of control is both confusing and likely to have poor performance.
