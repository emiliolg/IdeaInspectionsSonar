This inspection reports all instances of multiplication of an integer value by a constant power of 2.  These
expressions may be replaced by right or left shift operations, to some possible performance improvement.
<p>
Use the check box below to enable the inspection for divisions by a power of two also. Note that replacing
a power of two division by a shift does not work for negative numbers.
