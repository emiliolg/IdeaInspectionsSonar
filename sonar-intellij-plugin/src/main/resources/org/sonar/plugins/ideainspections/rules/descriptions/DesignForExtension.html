This inspection reports any methods which are not <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>,
    <b><font color="#000080">private</font></b>, <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">abstract</font></b>,
    and whose bodies are not empty.  Coding in a style that avoids such methods protects
    the contracts of classes from being broken by their subclasses.  The benefit of this style is that
    subclasses cannot corrupt the state of the superclass by forgetting to call the super method.
    The cost is that subclasses are limited in their flexibility, in particular they cannot prevent
    execution of code in the superclass. 
<p>
    This inspection is intended for code to be used in secure environments, and is probably not
    appropriate for less restrictive environments.
