This inspection reports any instances of method parameters declared <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> unnecessarily.
Some coding standards frown on such parameters, so as to have shorter and more
understandable parameter lists.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to only warn on final parameters of abstract or interface
methods, which may be considered extra unnecessary, as such markings have no
effect on the implementation of these methods.
