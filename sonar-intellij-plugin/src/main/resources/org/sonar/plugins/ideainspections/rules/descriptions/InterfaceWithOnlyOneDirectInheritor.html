This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.

This inspection reports any instances of interfaces which have precisely one
direct inheritor.  While such interfaces may offer admirable clarity of design,
in memory-constrained or bandwidth-limited environments,
they needlessly increase the total footprint of the application.  Consider
merging the interface with it's inheritor.</p>
