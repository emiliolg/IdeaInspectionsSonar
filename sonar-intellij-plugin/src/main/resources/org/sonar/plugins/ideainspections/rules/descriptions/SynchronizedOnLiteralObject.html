This inspection reports any <b><font color="#000080">synchronized</font></b>
block which locks on an object which is initilized with a literal.
String literals are interned and Number literals can be allocated from a cache.
Because of this, it is possible that some other part of the system
which uses an object initialized with the same literal, is actually holding a
reference to the exact same object. This can create unexpected dead-lock situations,
if the string was thought to be private.
