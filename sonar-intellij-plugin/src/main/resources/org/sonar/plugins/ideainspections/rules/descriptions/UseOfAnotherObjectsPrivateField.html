This inspection reports any uses of another object's private or protected fields.  Java
allows the use of such fields for objects of the same class as the current objects, but
some coding styles discourage this use.  Additionally, such direct access to private fields
may fail in component-oriented architectures such (e.g. Spring, Hibernate) which expect all access
to other objects to be through method calls so as to allow the framework to mediate all access
using proxies.
