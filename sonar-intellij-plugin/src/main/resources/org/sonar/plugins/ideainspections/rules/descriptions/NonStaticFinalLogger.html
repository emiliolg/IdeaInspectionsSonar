This inspection reports any instances of logger fields on classes which are not declared <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>.
and <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b>.
Ensuring that every classes logger is effectively constant and bound to that class
simplifies the task of providing a unified logging implementation for an application.   Interfaces,
enumerations, annotations, inner classes, and abstract classes are not reported by this inspection.
<p>
Use the field below to specify the name of the class which will be used for logging in this project.
Fields of that type which are not <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>.
and <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> will be reported by this inspection.
