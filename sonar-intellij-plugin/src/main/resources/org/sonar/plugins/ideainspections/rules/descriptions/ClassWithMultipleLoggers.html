This inspection reports any instances of classes which have multiple loggers declared.
Ensuring that every class has a single dedicated logger is an important step in providing a unified logging
implementation for an application.   Interfaces,
enumerations, annotations, inner classes, and abstract classes are not reported by this inspection.
<p>
Use the field below to specify the name of the class which will be used for logging in this project.
Classes which do declare multiple fields of that class will be reported by this inspection.
