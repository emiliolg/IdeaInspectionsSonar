This inspection reports any instances of methods which are highly coupled, i.e. that reference too many other classes.
Methods with too high a coupling can be very fragile, and should probably be broken up.  References to system classes
(those in the <b><font color="#000080">java.</font></b>or <b><font color="#000080">javax.</font></b> packages), are not
counted for purposes of this inspection.
<p>
Use the field provided below to specify the maximum acceptable coupling a method might have.
