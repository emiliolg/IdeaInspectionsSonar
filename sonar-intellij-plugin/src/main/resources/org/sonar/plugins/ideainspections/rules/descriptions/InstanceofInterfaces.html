This inspection reports on uses of <b><font color="#000080">instanceof</font></b> where the type checked for is a concrete class,
rather than an interface.  Such uses often indicate excessive coupling to concrete implementations, rather
than abstractions.  <b><font color="#000080">instanceof</font></b> expressions whose classes come from system or third-party libraries will not be reported by this inspection.
