    An inner class and its containing class are compiled to separate
    class files. The virtual machine normally prohibits access from a class to private fields and methods of
    another class.  To enable access from an inner class to private members of a
    containing class or the other way around javac and other compilers create package private
    synthetic accessor methods. Less use of memory and greater performance may be achieved by making the
    member package local, thus allowing direct access without the creation of synthetic accessor methods.
