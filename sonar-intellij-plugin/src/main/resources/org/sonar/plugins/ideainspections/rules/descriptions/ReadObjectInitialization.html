This inspection reports instances of instance variables which are not guaranteed to be initialized after the object is
deserialized by the <b><font color="#000080">readObject()</font></b> method.
<p>
Note: This inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report instance variables
as uninitialized incorrectly.  Variables reported as initialized will always be initialized.
