This inspection reports any <b><font color="#000080">while</font></b>,
<b><font color="#000080">do-while</font></b> and <b><font color="#000080">for</font></b>
loops which have the constant <b><font color="#000080">true</font></b> as their
only condition, but which still can be terminated by a containing
<b><font color="#000080">if</font></b> statement which can break out of the loop.
This <b><font color="#000080">if</font></b> statement must be the first or only statement
in a <b><font color="#000080">while</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">for</font></b>
loops and the last or only statement in a <b><font color="#000080">do-while</font></b> loop.
Such a loop would be clearer if the if statement was removed and its condition
was made an explicit loop condition.
