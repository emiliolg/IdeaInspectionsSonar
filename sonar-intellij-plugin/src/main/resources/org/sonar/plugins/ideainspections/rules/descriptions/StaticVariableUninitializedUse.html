	This inspection reports instances of <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b> variables which are read prior to initialization.

Use the checkbox below to indicate whether you want uninitialized primitive fields to be reported.

Note: This inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report static variables
used uninitialized incorrectly.  Variables reported as initialized will always be initialized.
