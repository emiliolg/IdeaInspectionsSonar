This inspection reports any instances of unnecessary local variables, which add
nothing to the comprehensibility of a method.  Variables caught include local variables
which are immediately returned, local variables that are immediately assigned to another
variable and then not used, and local variables which always have the same value as another
local variable or parameter.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to have this inspection ignore variables which are immediately
returned or thrown.  Some coding styles suggest using such variables for clarity and
ease of debugging.
