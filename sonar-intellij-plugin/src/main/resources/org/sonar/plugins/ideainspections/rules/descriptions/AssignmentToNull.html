        This inspection reports any instances of the assignment of a variable to
        <b><font color="#000080">null</font></b>, outside of declarations.
        While occasionally useful for triggering garbage collection, this
        construct may make the code more prone
        to NullPointerExceptions, and often indicates that the developer doesn't
        really understand the class's intended semantics.
