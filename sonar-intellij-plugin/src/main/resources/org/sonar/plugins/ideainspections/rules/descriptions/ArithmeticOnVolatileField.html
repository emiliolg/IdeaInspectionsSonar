This inspection reports any uses of volatile fields in arithmetic operations.
It's a common misconception that such operations are effectively atomic, but the
Java Memory Model only specifies that loads and stores on volatile variables are
atomic. This can lead to unexpected results, including lost updates, when using
volatile fields in arithmetic operations.
