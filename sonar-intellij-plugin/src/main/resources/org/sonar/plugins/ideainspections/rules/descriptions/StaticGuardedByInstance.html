                This inspection reports any @net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy annotations on static fields or methods,
                where
                the guard is either a non-static field or 'this'. Guarding a static by a non-static may result in
                excessive
                concurrency, multiple threads may be able to access the guarded field simultaneously, by locking in
                different
                object contexts.
