This inspection reports any attempt to return an array or <b><font color="#000080">Collection</font></b> field from a method.  Since
the array or <b><font color="#000080">Collection</font></b> may have its contents modified by the calling method, this construct may
result in an object having its state modified unexpectedly.  While occasionally useful for performance
reasons, this construct is inherently bug-prone.
