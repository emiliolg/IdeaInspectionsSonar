This inspection reports on any instance of unnecessary parentheses. Parentheses
are considered unnecessary if the evaluation order of an expression remains
unchanged if the parentheses are removed.
<p>
Use the first checkbox below to ignore parentheses which help to clarify a binary
expression. Parentheses are clarifying if the expression parenthesized is an
<b><font color="#000080">instanceof</font></b> expression part of a larger
expression or has a different operator than the parent expression.<br>
Use the second checkbox below to ignore any parentheses around the condition
of conditional expressions. Some coding standards specify that all such conditions
must be surrounded by parentheses.
