This inspection reports any instances of synchronization which use <b><font color="#000080">this</font></b> as their lock
expression.  Constructs reported include <b><font color="#000080">synchronized</font></b>
blocks which lock <b><font color="#000080">this</font></b>, and calls to <b><font color="#000080">wait()</font></b>,
<b><font color="#000080">notify()</font></b> or <b><font color="#000080">notifyAll()</font></b> which target <b><font color="#000080">wait()</font></b>.
Such constructs, like synchronized methods, make it hard to track just who is locking on a given
object, and make possible "denial of service" attacks on objects.  As an alternative, consider
locking on a private instance variable, access to which can be completely controlled.
