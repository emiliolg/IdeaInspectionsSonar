This inspection reports any instances where local variables are "reused", overwriting their
values with new values unrelated to their original use.  Such local variable reuse may be confusing,
as the intended semantics of the local variable may vary with each use.  It may also be
prone to bugs, if code changes result in values that were thought to be overwritten actually
being live.   It is good practices to keep variable lifetimes as short as possible, and not
reuse local variables for the sake of brevity.
