<font face="verdana" size="-1">This inspection reports any instances of tail recursion, that is when a method calls itself
as its last action before returning.  Tail recursion can always be replaced by looping, which will be considerably faster.
Some JVMs perform this optimization, while others do not.  Thus, tail recursive solutions may have considerably different
performance characteristics on different virtual machines.
