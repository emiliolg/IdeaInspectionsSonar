  This inspection warns you of characters that current encoding is incapable to represent.<br>
  E.g. when you are trying to type international characters in an <b>US-ASCII</b>-encoded file.<br>
  Typically, you would fix this by changing the file encoding,
  either by specifying the encoding directly in the file, e.g. by editing <b>encoding=</b> attribute in the XML prolog of XML file,
  or configuring the <b>Settings|General|File Encoding|Default encoding</b> setting,
  or by setting up the file/directory encoding in the <b>Settings|File/Directory Options|File Encodings</b>.
