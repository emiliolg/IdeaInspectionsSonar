This inspection reports possible escapes of <b><font color="#000080">this</font></b>
during object construction. Escapes occur when <b><font color="#000080">this</font></b>
is used as a method argument or the object of an assignment in a constructor or
initializer.  Such escapes may result in subtle bugs, as the object is now
available in a context in which it is not guaranteed to be initialized.
