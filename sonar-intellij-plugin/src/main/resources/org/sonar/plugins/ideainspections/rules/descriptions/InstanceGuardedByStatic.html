                This inspection reports any @net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy annotations on instance fields or methods,
                where
                the guard is a static field. Guarding a non-static by a static may result in excessive lock contention,
                as access to each locked field in any object instance will prevent simultaneous access to that field in
                every object
                instance.
