This inspection reports any methods which may safely be made <b><font color="#000080">static</font></b>.
A method may be static if it is not synchronized, it does not reference any of its class' non static methods 
and non static fields and is not overridden in a sub class.
<p>
Use the checkboxes below to inspect only <b><font color="#000080">private</font></b>
or <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> methods, which increases the
performance of this inspection and to ignore empty methods.
