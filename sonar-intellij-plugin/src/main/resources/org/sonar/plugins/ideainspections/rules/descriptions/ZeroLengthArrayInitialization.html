This inspection reports on allocations of arrays with known lengths of zero.  Since array lengths in
Java are non-modifiable, it is almost always possible to share zero-length arrays, rather than repeatedly
allocating new zero-length arrays.  Such sharing may provide useful optimizations in program runtime or
footprint.  Note that this inspection does not report zero-length arrays allocated as static final fields,
as it is assumed that those arrays are being used to implement array sharing.
