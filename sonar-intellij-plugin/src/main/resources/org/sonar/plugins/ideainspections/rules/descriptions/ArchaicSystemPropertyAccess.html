This inspection reports any calls to Integer.getInteger() or Boolean.getBoolean().
These methods fetch integer and boolean values from the
system properties for a given key.  Due to their underexpressive names and confusing
location of functionality, it's easy for novice programmers to attempt to use these
for other purposes, such as string parsing.
