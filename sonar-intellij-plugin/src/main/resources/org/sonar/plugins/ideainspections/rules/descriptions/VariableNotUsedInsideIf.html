This inspection reports any references to variables which are checked for nullity
in the condition of an <b><font color="#000080">if</font></b> statement or
conditional, expression but which are not used inside the
<b><font color="#000080">if</font></b> statement. Usually this either means that
the check is unnecessary or that the variable is not referenced inside the
<b><font color="#000080">if</font></b> statement because of a typo.
