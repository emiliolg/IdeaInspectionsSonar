This inspection reports any calls to a variable-argument method which has a primitive array in
in the variable-argument position (e.g <b><font color="#000080">System.out.printf("%s", new int[]{1, 2, 3})</font></b> ).
Such a primitive-array argument may be confusing, as it will wrapped as a single-element array, rather than each individual
 element being boxed, as might be expected.
