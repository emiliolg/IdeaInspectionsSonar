This inspection is intended for J2ME and other highly resource constrained environments.
Applying the results of this inspection without consideration might have negative effects on code clarity and design.

This inspection reports any instances of fields which are accessed three or more times by a given method,
or which are accessed in a loop.  While such field access may be logically correct, it is often more performant
to replace such accesses with local variables, copying the fields to a temporary local and copying back if necessary.
</p><p>
Use the checkbox below to ignore instances of <b><font color="#000080">final</font></b> fields being repeatedly accessed, as many compilers and JVMs
can optimize that case without explicit creation of a temporary local variable.   Constant fields are always ignored by this inspection.
