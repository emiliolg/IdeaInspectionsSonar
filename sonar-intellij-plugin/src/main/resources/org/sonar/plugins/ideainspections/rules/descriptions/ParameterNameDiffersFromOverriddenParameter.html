This inspection reports parameters that have different names from the corresponding
parameters in the methods they override.  While legal in Java, such inconsistent names may be confusing,
and lessen the documentation benefits of good naming practices.
<p>
    Use the checkboxes below to indicate whether overridden parameter names which are only
a single character long or come from a library method should be ignored. Both can be useful if
you do not wish to be bound by dubious naming conventions used in libraries.
