This inspection reports any instances of constructors which do not begin with calls to "super" constructor, or
other constructors of the same class.  Such constructors can be thought of as implicitly beginning with a
call to <b><font color="#000080">super()</font></b>.  Some coding standards prefer that such calls to
<b><font color="#000080">super()</font></b> be made explicitly.
