This inspection reports any calls to <b><font color="#000080">System.runFinalizersOnExit()</font></b>.
This call is one of the most dangerous in the Java language.  It is inherently non-thread-safe,
may result in data corruption, deadlock, and may effect parts of the program far removed from its call point.
It is deprecated, and its use strongly discouraged.
